writing some text to ensure that deploy is working

testing a mathematics formula rendered by Katex, inline: $e^i\pi = -1$, and block :

$$\hat f(n)=\int_0^1e^{-2\pi int}f(t)dt$$

adding a blockquote:

> people die, if they are killed...

testing signing

testing an inline footnote ^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]

Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
    belong to the previous footnote.
