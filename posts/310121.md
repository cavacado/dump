# first post

hello world from eleventy

testing out this static site generator as an attempt to create a blog to write technical / fun / useful? thoughts

testing some code block:

```js
const foo = "bar";
```

testing an embedded image:

![cat getting covid check](/images/covid_cat.jpg)

testing a link to another [website](https://cavacado.github.io/portfolio/)

things to do for this:

- read up more on eleventy
- add a link from portfolio website
- refactor the sharp plus responsiveimage transformer
